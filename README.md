# CUSP_Waste_GRA

This is a GRA project at the Center for Urban Science and Progress at NYU. The aim is to understand the drivers of waste generation in New York City, from 10 years of DSNY data.

## Plan of Action
   1. Aggregate the socio-economic data at the DSNY section level
   2. Run a statistical analysis on the links between waste generation and socio-economic variables
   3. Use the coefficients to better disaggregate the DSNY section data at the block level

## Disclaimer
The data coming from the Department of Sanitation, I am not allowed to post everything in open-source.
